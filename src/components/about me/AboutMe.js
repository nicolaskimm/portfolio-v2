        <span>  I never thought that one day I will be an aspiring programmist. 
            My story doesn't start with 'since I was kid I loved computers and 
            spent hours learning how they work and what possibilites they give'.
            I was more like 'oh yes, I love might and magic 3 and oh my god, my 
            computer can run crazy taxi 3!'. Maybe I understimate myself, cause 
            I have little understanding of whats happenning behind big black box. 
            My father worked in RTV service, so I could often look at graphic cards, 
            motherboards and of course tvs. My interest in programming started few 
            months ago. It began with codecademy and after - 'Programuj dziewczyno' workshops. 
            After month of learning on my own I invested my money and time in Kodilla bootcamp. 
            This journey took me 6 months, but gave me so much excitement! Most of my time
            I spend on learning JavaScript and enhancement this knowledge with ReactJS library, 
            NPM package ecosystem, Node.js runtime and his web framework - Express. 
            In my program was also place for MongoDB database and it's GUI - Robo 3T. 
            I want to learn more and more. Now I know that I'm more interested in 
            backend side of coding. I'd really love to learn more about ReactJS - it's 
            such a cool and powerfull library. Now, when I've finished bootcamp,
            I'm looking for my first employment as a junior web developer.
